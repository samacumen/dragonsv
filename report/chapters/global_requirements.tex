\section*{Global Requirements}
\label{sec:global_req}
In this chapter, we list the global requirements essential for the design of the controller:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Each elevator, rack and conveyor belt contains at most one packet.
\item Packet is exchanged only when the elevator platform is at the same level as that of a conveyor belt.
\item Packet is exchanged only when elevator platform is at the same level as that of a rack.
\item The lower elevator must never pass the upper one.
\item Packets are always delivered in the same order as requested.
\item If a packet is ready to enter and there is a free position at the rack(s), it will be eventually accepted.
\item If a requested packet is in the system, it will be eventually delivered. %unless the system shuts down
\item If a packet is unable to be located, an alarm must be generated.
\item The number of packets in the system can at most be equal to the number of racks.
 
%\item If the input conveyor malfunctions, the remaining packets inside the system must be able to leave, eventually.

%\item \textbf{How:} It should be always possible to know the number of packets in the system.(design decision we will confirm this one after we have decided about working mechanism of our system.)

%\item \textbf{Assumption:} Lower elevator cannot reach the lowest rack and highest elevator cannot reach the highest rack.(remove this one.Since it is included in 4, we do not need to state it again.)

\end{enumerate}
