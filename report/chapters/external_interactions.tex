% External requirements table with actions/ variables/ sync_comm.
\label{sec:ext_interactions}
This section lists the external interactions for the packet storage system. These are the high actions that are essential for the design of the system. The table \ref{tab: ext_interactions} lists the interactions in the system, with first column denoting the name of the action, second column lists its description and the third column lists the parameters essential for that action. The internal actions within the system are described in a later section.

\textit{Note:} The parameters for the actions can be shared, which means that they are part of two different actions which need to be synchronized.
