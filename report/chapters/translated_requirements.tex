%Lists all the translated global requirements
% This must cover all possible scenario for each of the global requirements that we decided.
% I have tried to list out all possiblities (in a way that modal-u-calculus) can be written for these translations (sounding negative is important to formulate modal formula much easily). Refer to the report from last year. Feel free to include anything that I may have missed out. (Leave a comment also so that we are aware what changed)

This section lists the requirements from section \ref{sec:global_req} in terms of interactions described in section \ref{sec:ext_interactions}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Each elevator, rack and conveyor belt contains at most one packet}

	\textit{Conveyor Belt}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item
	Whenever an AcceptPacket(id: packetID) action is performed it
	is not possible to perform another sequence of AcceptPacket(id:
	packetId) unless an ConvToElevator(e: elevID) action is
	performed(where, e can be one of the two elevators)
	\item Whenever ElevToConvOut(e: elevID) action is performed it is
	not possible to perform another sequence of ElevToConvOut(e: 
	elevID)   unless a DeliverPacket(id: packetID) action is performed.
	\end{itemize}
	\textit{Elevator}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Whenever a ConvToElev(e: elevID) or RackToElev(e: elevID) 
	action is performed it is not possible to perform another
	ConvToElev(e: elevID) or RackToElev(e: elevID) unless an 
	ElevToRack(e: elevID) or ElevToConv(e: elevID) action is performed.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\textit{Rack}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Whenever an ElevToRack(p: pos) action is done it is not
	possible to perform another ElevToRack(p: pos) unless a RackToElev 
	(p: pos) action is performed.
	\end{itemize}

\item \textit{ Packet is exchanged only when the elevator platform is at
the same level as that of a conveyor belt}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Whenever a ConvInToElev(e: elevID) or a ElevToConvOut(e: 
	elevID) is done a MoveElevator(e :elevId, 0: pos) must be
	performed first.(Assumption: Input and output conveyor are at
	position zero).	
	\end{itemize}

\item \textit{Packet is exchanged only when elevator platform is at the same level as that of a rack}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item ElevatorToRack(e: elevID) action can only be performed after
	MoveElevator(e: elevID, p: pos) action.
	\end{itemize}
	
\item \textit{The two elevators cannot be at the same position}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The GetPosition(e1: elevId, p: pos) action and
	GetPosition(e2: elevID, p: pos) actions cannot occur
	simultaneously (from the two controllers C3/C4).\\
	\textit{Note:} The target position for both elevators has been
	indicated as $p$.
	\end{itemize}
		
\item \textit{The lower elevator must never pass the upper one}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Controller C4 cannot initiate the MoveElevator(e1: elevID, p1: pos) action when controller C3 is performs GetPosition(e2: elevID, p2: pos) action.
	\item Controller C3 cannot perform MoveElevator(e2: elevID, p2: pos) 
	action when controller C4 performs GetPosition(e1: elevID, p1: pos) 
	action.\\
	\textit{Note:} Here, p1$<$p2 and e1, e2 is the upper elevator and 
	lower elevator, respectively.
	\end{itemize}
	
\item \textit{Packets are always delivered in the same order as
	requested}	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item 
	For all WantOut($id$: packetID) and a following WantOut($id$: 
	packetID) it should be never be possible to perform
	DeliverPacket($id$: packetID) followed by DeliverPacket($id$: 
	packetID).
	\end{itemize}
	
\item \textit{If a packet is ready to enter and there is a free
	position at the rack(s), it will be eventually accepted}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item When WantIn(id: packetID) action triggers and there is a 
	QueryRackSpace(true) follows, eventually an AcceptPacket(ID) action 
	must be performed. 
	\end{itemize}
	
\item \textit{If a requested packet is in the system, it will be
	eventually delivered}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Whenever there is an AcceptPacket(id: packetID) action 
	eventually a DeliverPacket(id: packetID) must be performed.  
	\end{itemize}
	
\item \textit{If a packet is unable to be located, a unique alarm must 
	be generated}
	\begin{itemize}	
	\item  Whenever an action AcceptPacket(id: packetID) and eventually 
	an action PacketNotFound(id: packetID) is performed, an action 
	Alarm(err: error\_Type) must be followed.
	\end{itemize}
		
\item \textit{The number of packets in the system can at most be equal to the number of racks}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Whenever a QueryRackSpace(false) action occurs the
	AcceptPacket(id: packetID) action cannot happen. 
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
