%Lists all the translated global requirements
% This must cover all possible scenario for each of the global requirements that we decided.
% I have tried to list out all possiblities (in a way that modal-u-calculus) can be written for these translations (sounding negative is important to formulate modal formula much easily). Refer to the report from last year. Feel free to include anything that I may have missed out. (Leave a comment also so that we are aware what changed)

This section lists the requirements from section \ref{sec:global_req} in terms of interactions described in section \ref{sec:ext_interactions}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Each elevator, rack and conveyor belt contains at most one packet}

	\textit{Conveyor Belt}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item
	Whenever an AcceptPacket(id: packetID) action is performed it
	is not possible to perform another AcceptPacket(id:
	packetId) unless a ConvToElevator(e: elevID) action is
	performed in the meanwhile (where, e can be one of the two elevators)
	\item Whenever ElevToConvOut(e: elevID) action is performed it is
	not possible to perform another ElevToConvOut(e: 
	elevID) unless a DeliverPacket(id: packetID) action is performed in the meanwhile.
	\end{itemize}
	\textit{Elevator}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Whenever a ConvToElev(e: elevID) or RackToElev(e: elevID) 
	action is performed it is not possible to perform another
	ConvToElev(e: elevID) or RackToElev(e: elevID) unless an 
	ElevToRack(e: elevID) or ElevToConv(e: elevID) action is performed.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\textit{Rack}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Whenever an ElevToRack(p: pos, r: rackID) action is done it is not
	possible to perform another ElevToRack(p: pos, r: rackID) unless a RackToElev(p: pos, r: rackID) action is performed.
	\end{itemize}

\item \textit{ Packet is exchanged only when the elevator platform is at
the same level as that of a conveyor belt}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Whenever a ConvInToElev(e: elevID) or a ElevToConvOut(e: 
	elevID) is done a MoveElevator(e :elevId, 0: pos) must be
	performed first.(Assumption: Input and output conveyor are at
	position zero).	
	\end{itemize}

\item \textit{Packet is exchanged only when elevator platform is at the same level as that of a rack}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item ElevToRack(e: elevID, r: rackID) action can only be performed after
	MoveElevator(e: elevID, p: pos) action.
	\end{itemize}
	
\item \textit{The two elevators cannot be at the same position}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item If the last action from type MoveElevator(e: elevID, p: pos)
	there cannot be MoveElevator(e': elevID, p: pos) action unless 
	MoveElevator(e: elevID, p': pos) action takes place.
	

	\end{itemize}
		
\item \textit{The lower elevator must never pass the upper one}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Controller C4 cannot initiate the MoveElevator(e: elevID, p: pos) 
	action if the last type of action of controller C3 is MoveElevator(e': elevID, p': pos).
	
	
	\\
	\textit{Note:} Here, p$>$p' and e, e' is the upper elevator and 
	lower elevator, respectively. We assume C4 controller to control
	the lower elevator and C3 controls the upper elevator.
	\end{itemize}
	
	
\item \textit{Packets are always delivered in the same order as
	requested}	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Reception of latest requested packet cannot happen before
	the reception of the previously 'unprocessed' requested packet.
	\end{itemize}
	
\item \textit{If a packet is ready to enter and there is a free
	position at the rack(s), it will be eventually accepted}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item If there is no free position in racks, packet must not be 
	accepted.
	\item If there is a free position in the racks and the packet is 
	ready to enter, it must be eventually stored.
	\end{itemize}
	
\item \textit{If a requested packet is in the system, it will be
	eventually delivered}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item If a packet is requested and it is in the system, it must be
	delivered eventually.
	\item If a packet is requested and it is not in the system, no 
	packet is delivered.
	\end{itemize}
	
\item \textit{If a packet is unable to be located, a unique alarm must 
	be generated}
	\begin{itemize}	
	\item If the requested packet is not located in the racks, a alarm
	is generated.
	\end{itemize}
		
\item \textit{The number of packets in the system can at most be equal to the number of racks}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The number packets in the racks cannot be greater than the 
	number of racks in the system.
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
